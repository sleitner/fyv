<h2>Frequently asked questions</h2> <p>
<h4>Why doesn't X work?</h4> <p>
This page is very much pre-alpha form. It exists as a demo only at this point. If you have stumbled upon it, please come back in a couple of months for the complete, interesting, and functional version. 
<h4>What are your data sources?</h4> <p>
In general, voting histories have to be requested directly from Security of State offices with each state having different rules and fees for aquiring the data. Allowed uses of said data vary by state, but the data can never be used for commercial purposes.
