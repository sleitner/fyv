<h2>Site Usage</h2> 

Friend your vote is a tool to help mobilize voters by providing easy access to public voting records along with some context, and twitter interaction. Currently, data is only available for New York State.
The site can either be used to look up specific voters, or you can use the twitter sign-in to match the full name of all the Twitter users you follow, to the NY state voter database. In the near future a screen-cast on this page will step through the site's main features.
