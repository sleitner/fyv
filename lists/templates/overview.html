<h2>Site Usage</h2> 

Friend your vote is a tool to help mobilize New York State voters by providing easy access to public voting records along with some context, and twitter interaction. 
The site can either be used to look up specific voters, or you can use the twitter sign-in to match the full name of all the Twitter users you follow, to a voter database. Visit again in the near future for a screen-cast that will step through the site's main features.
